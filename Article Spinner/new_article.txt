two roads diverged in a yellow wood
and then he could not travel both
and sinister one traveler long he stood
and low down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then in the other as just as fair
and having girdled the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black
oh i kept the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i get if opportunity should ever come back
